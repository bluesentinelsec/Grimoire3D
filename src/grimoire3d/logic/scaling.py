"""Business logic for virtual resolution, integer scaling, and letterboxing.

All functions here are pure and fully testable without a window or OpenGL.
They implement the professional "resolution independence via integer
scaling + letterboxing" behavior mandated by the design goals.

The computed Viewport tells the renderer exactly which physical pixel
rectangle to use for glViewport and how to configure the orthographic
projection so that game drawing code can work entirely in virtual
coordinates (default 1280x720).

    The game is always drawn using the *full* virtual (logical) coordinate
    space (e.g. 0..1280, 0..720). This function computes how to map that
    logical surface into the actual OS window:

      - scale = the factor that makes the entire logical surface fit
        inside the physical window while preserving aspect ratio.
      - The content is centered with letterbox/pillarbox bars as needed.
      - glViewport is set to the resulting centered sub-rectangle.

    This means:
    - When the window is larger than the virtual resolution, the logical
      scene is scaled *up* (and letterboxed).
    - When the window is smaller, the logical scene is scaled *down* so
      the **full** content remains visible (just smaller on screen).
    - integer_scaling=True (default) prefers crisp integer scales when
      upscaling is possible. When the window is too small for 1:1, it
      falls back to fractional downscaling so you never lose part of the
      logical surface.

    rectangle to use for the viewport + how the orthographic projection
    should be configured.
