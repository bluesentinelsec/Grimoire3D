"""Pause policy: pure functions over PauseState and MultiplayerConfig.

All functions are pure — no side effects, no GL, no pygame.  They are the
single place where the "can network games pause?" rule is enforced, so no
caller ever needs an explicit `if network:` branch.

Typical game-loop usage:

    # On ENTER key:
    state = state.with_updates(pause=toggle_pause(state.pause, cfg).to_dict())

    # Per-frame:
    if not is_paused(state.pause, GROUP_GAMEPLAY):
        n = sim_clock.update(dt)
        for _ in range(n):
            ...advance gameplay...

    # Audio subsystem:
    if not is_paused(state.pause, GROUP_AUDIO):
        audio.update(dt)

    # UI always runs — check omitted entirely.
